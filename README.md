# Project: Frontend Concept for IceCore.ai

### About The Project

This repository contains a conceptual frontend prototype for the IT company IceCore.ai. I developed this project as a freelance/volunteer initiative to demonstrate my skills in modern web development and propose a new, interactive user interface for the company's website.

The landing page is fully responsive and includes several interactive elements to create a dynamic user experience.

### Key Features

*   **Clean, Responsive Layout:** Built with modern CSS (Flexbox & Grid) to ensure a great look on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
*   **Interactive Product Demonstration:** A key feature where hovering over a service description highlights the corresponding area on a dashboard mock-up, visually explaining the product's value.
*   **Dynamic UI/UX Elements:** Subtle animations, transitions, and a mouse-following glow effect to make the page feel alive and professional.
*   **Component-Based Structure:** The code is organized into logical sections (Hero, Features, Team, CTA), making it clean and understandable.

### Tech Stack

This is a pure front-end project built with:
*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3** (with advanced features like animations, gradients, and `backdrop-filter`)
*   **JavaScript (ES6)** (for DOM manipulation and interactive features)
